        <h1 style="text-align:center">If I am happier, do I spend more time on Youtube?</h1>
        <p style="text-align: left">It is my hypothesis that the circles which are green will typically
            be the highest type of circles on the y axis because I believe the happier I am, the more Youtube videos I
            consume which
            means more minutes spent on Youtube. By tracking my daily mood and how many minutes I spent on Youtube on
            that same day I can start to see if my hypothesis is conclusive on inconclusive based off of patterns,
            correlations and trends discovered once more data is collected.</p>
